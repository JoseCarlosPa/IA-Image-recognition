# IA-Image-Recognition

_This project has the purpose of being able to relate the principles learned and only mentioned during the case of Intelligent Systems, thanks to the curiosity and guidance of the teacher, it is proposed to carry out a program that allows to recognize numbers written by hands through a neural network.
Keras and MNIST will be used as main tools according to the teacher's recommendations._
